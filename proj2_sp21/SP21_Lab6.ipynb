    "2. Connect one of the ground pins on the Launchpad to the ground rail of your breadboard.\n",
    "3. Connect your 9V wall adapter to power your motors (connect it through the switch, just like in the Front End lab) as well as your regulators to power your encoders.\n",
    "4. **Connect the input resistor of the left motor's driver circuit to `P2.0` and the input resistor of the right motor's driver circuit to `P1.5`.** (Connect the pins to the ends of the resistors that are NOT connected to the BJT)\n",
    "5. **If your encoders are powered properly, the LEDs on each one should blink when you pass something through the encoders.**\n",
    "6. Remove the encoder wheels (the plastic disk with holes in it) if they are on the car. Upload **`encoder_test_0_ticks.ino`** to the Launchpad.\n",
    "7. Open the serial monitor.\n",
    "8. **Set the baud rate to `38400`**.\n",
    "9. Press reset.\n",
    "10. Follow the instructions on the serial monitor.\n",
    "    - **Your car wheels are going to move.** Make sure that you hold the car above the table/ground. Don't let your car jump off the table.\n",
    "    - Button P2.1 is the bottom left button of the LaunchPad.\n",
    "    - The test will conduct 4 phases: both wheels at rest, one wheel driving, the other wheel driving, and both wheels driving.\n",
    "    - If your encoders are functioning properly, the serial monitor should print \"Success\" or \"Success if encoder wheels are off\" after each phase, and display all 0s (or at least no more than a few ticks) for the ticks per phase. Note that if your car is mis-wired, this could be a false negative.\n",
    "    - This diagnostics message will be followed up by a long and repeating string of the actual values measured during the duration of the program. If you want to look at just the encoder diagnostics, make sure to untick `Autoscroll` in the bottom left of the Serial Monitor window.\n",
    "11. Attach the encoder disk as shown below.\n",
    "    - If it is on, make sure to remove the paper sticker from your car frame (yes, it does come off) before you attach the encoders.\n",
    "    - If some of the holes on the encoder wheel were not fully cut out, use a screwdriver to push the material out.\n",
    "12. Re-run the tests. If your car is connected correctly, **the tests should show several hundred encoder ticks**, ruling out a false negative. You should also see it print \"Failure if encoder wheels are off. Success if encoder wheels are on.\"\n",

Glance through the sketch - it records the position of each wheel while varying the input signal $u[k]$ linearly from HIGH_PWM to LOW_PWM and back up. The sampling period is $T_s = 500\\mathrm{ms}$. A long sampling period is used to minimize error due to quantization, the rounding error from measuring only integer encoder ticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: For this first test, make sure that you are using the first set of 5 parameters in code block `SID1`** (abbreviated from System ID 1). These parameters will sweep through a range of PWM values, from 200 to 100 and back to 200 (the maximimum value a PWM can have is 255 and minimum is 0), while collecting 2 samples per PWM. The car will start fast, slow down, and speed back up during the test (it's possible that the car may stop in the middle before driving again if a PWM of 100 is not enough to get it to drive).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1. About Data Collection:\n",
    "1. We will being using **`dynamics_data.ino`** to collect data for our car and read it to the serial monitor.\n",
    "2. Upon being uploaded to the MSP, **`dynamics_data.ino`.** does either one of two things, depending on whether the **`WRITE`** variable located at the top of the code is **`1`** or **`0`**. \n",
    "    - If **`WRITE == 1`** - The car upon having the leftmost bottom button pressed will run and collect data, then write it into nonvolatile (permanent) memory called flash, which will survive between resets and power supply removal, unlike volatile memory like RAM. The collected data will be overwritten if data collection is run again.\n",
    "    - If **`WRITE == 0`** - The car upon having its leftmost bottom button pressed will read data collected from its last run that is stored in flash and output it onto the Serial Monitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are somethings to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "In general: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The leftmost button is unresponsive at times, so you may have to press it multiple times. You will know you have succeeded in making the MSP bend to your will if the LEDs blink.\n",
    "- If things are still unresponsive, press the reset button.\n",
    "- **Don't connect both 5V from the voltage regulator and the USB from the computer to the MSP at the same time. This tends to fry the launchpad.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If running the car and collecting data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember that the MSP needs power from 5V pin if not connected to the Computer\n",
    "- **Secure your MSP** to your car so that it does not fall off while the car is moving!\n",
    "- Look for a large space to run your car. You want to try to minimize the number of collisions it makes with the objects or walls around it for the best data.\n",
    "    - If it's on a collision course with an object or wall you can quickly pick it up and change its direction before it hits.\n",
    "- Your car will most likely not go straight. Think about why this is.\n",
    "- Make sure you flip the switch to connect the motors to 9V before running it.\n",
    "- If your car makes *very* tight circles (ie: radius less than 1 ft), talk to your GSI! Some quick fixes may be:\n",
    "    - Check to see if your motor wheels are turning in the right direction (the back of the car is the castor wheel).\n",
    "    - Making sure the castor wheel (the white wheel that swivels) is aligned with your car (straight, and not turned at an angle) before running dynamics_data.ino. You may need to accomplish this by restraining the sides of the wheel with either wires or tape.\n",
    "    - Using a smaller range of PWM values (i.e. 90-150 instead of 100-200)\n",
    "    - Try to find a wide, flat space to run your car. If you can't get access to a space like this, make sure your car doesn't bump into walls (pick it up and redirect it before it collides).\n",
    "    - If you fry one of your PWM pins, you can use one of the other PWM pins, which are `P1.4`, `P1.5`, `P2.0`, `P2.4`, and `P2.5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If reading the data from the MSP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is printed in lines as comma separated 3-tuples. \n",
    "- Copy and paste, ONLY these 3-tuples, nothing else.\n",
