    "\n",
    "We will also be implementing turning in this phase. The car needs to follow 4 different commands: turn left, turn right, drive straight far, and drive straight close. In the Controls phase, we implemented a closed loop controller that succeeded in controlling the car to drive in a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our control scheme for SIXT33N modeled each wheel in the following way: $d_R[n+1] = d_R[n] + \\theta_R u_R[n] - \\beta_R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open loop model has an input $u[n]$, corresponding to the PWM level, and outputs the distance for that wheel. We implemented a closed-loop controller by using the desired velocity and the difference between the wheel distances, $\\delta[n] = d_L[n] - d_R[n]$.\n",
